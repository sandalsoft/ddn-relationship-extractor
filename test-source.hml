  description: >
    This logs processes (e.g., chrome.exe) executed on a system, with a unique execution_id, system_id, process name, process ID, parent process ID, start/end times, command line, and username. It connects to systems as a record of active software execution, often spawned by installed_applications or running_Services. It relates to network_connections (processes initiating network activity), file_accesses (processes interacting with files), and system_stats (resource usage), providing a dynamic view of system activity. For example, a "java.exe" process might link to a vulnerable Log4j instance.
